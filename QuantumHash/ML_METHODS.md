# Machine Learning Methods in ExoSuite

This document explains the machine learning strategies embedded within the ExoSuite engines, including references, algorithms used, and future extensibility options.

## üîç 1. Symbolic-Assisted ML Filtering

Symbolic rules (e.g., digit patterns, mod classes, known residues) are used as a prefilter to eliminate obvious non-primes or unworthy candidates before any ML layer engages.

ML augments this by:
- Scoring ambiguous candidates post-symbolic filtering
- Using pattern recognition to identify regions of statistical promise

---

## üß† 2. Reinforcement Learning for Candidate Scoring

The `CandidateScoringEngine` module leverages RL methods to assign and adjust confidence scores to numerical inputs.

**Key Features:**
- Rewards based on confirmed prime discoveries
- Penalties based on false positives or misclassifications
- State is defined by feature vectors extracted from candidate number properties

**Suggested RL Frameworks:**
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Multi-armed Bandit Models (exploration vs exploitation)

## üßÆ 3. Symbolic-to-Statistical Bridge

ExoSuite uses heuristic features extracted from symbolic logic to generate input vectors:
- Last-digit residue class
- Prime-adjacency likelihood score
- Symbolic cache history
- ML-driven feature extraction (e.g., digit entropy, distribution)

---

## üî¨ 4. Example Heuristics

- **Truncation Likelihood**: Numbers ending in '27', '51' often fail Miller-Rabin
- **Frequency Bias**: Numbers near known prime clusters are weighted higher
- **Entropy Check**: Digit randomness may indicate prime-likeness

## üõ† 6. Extending ML in ExoSuite

- Add feature vectors to `shared_data_exchange.py`
- Introduce reward tracking in `candidate_scoring_engine.py`
- Plug reinforcement model into batch selector for candidate zones

This layer remains modular and will be expanded in future ExoSuite ML modules.
