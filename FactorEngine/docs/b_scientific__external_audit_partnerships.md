# B. Scientific & External Audit Partnerships

To establish trust in PrimeEngineAI’s technical claims, the following audit-friendly mechanisms are in place:
• Scientific advisors granted access to symbolic filtering methods and benchmark validation logs
• Licensed enterprise and academic users receive replay scripts and hashed datasets for reproduction of filtering outcomes
• Third-party performance auditors will independently test symbolic exclusion and ML classification accuracy

These procedures allow for transparency, external trust-building, and reproducibility without compromising IP security.
