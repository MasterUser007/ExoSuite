# 1. Year 1 (2025–2026) – Expansion & Optimization

The first year focuses on core infrastructure enhancement and validation through early adopters:
• Symbolic Filtering Enhancements – Add dynamic rule weighting and adaptive cache pruning logic to improve symbolic filtering accuracy and throughput.
• GPU Kernel Optimization – Tune CUDA occupancy, memory transfers, and kernel batch distribution for improved single- and multi-GPU efficiency.
• Proprietary Dataset Growth – Log symbolic outcomes, false positives, and validated primes to compound the platform’s knowledge base.
• Partnership Pilots – Launch academic and industry engagements with blockchain and number theory groups for proof-of-use and feedback.
• ML Training Pipeline – Release version 1 of the symbolic exclusion classifier with supervised training data.
• Benchmark Publication – Publicly release third-party validated performance metrics, reproducible logs, and candidate-level trace files.
