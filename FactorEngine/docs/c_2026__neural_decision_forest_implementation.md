# C. 2026 – Neural Decision Forest Implementation

As filtering complexity increases, PrimeEngineAI will adopt a Neural Decision Forest (NDF) classifier to replace the decision tree baseline. This model will offer:
• Smoother decision boundaries with soft-routing neural logic
• Greater generalization on ambiguous symbolic edge cases
• End-to-end GPU training support for batch processing speed

D. 2027 – AI-Assisted Factoring Heuristics Prototype

The final major milestone in the roadmap introduces a new class of ML-driven tools: AI-assisted factoring guidance. These tools will:
• Predict numeric structures more likely to reveal useful factors under ECM/sieve methods
• Score candidates based on symbolic decomposition features
• Pre-filter composite-heavy batches to prioritize tractable workloads
This marks the extension of PrimeEngineAI’s mission from pure primality discovery into algorithmically assisted composite analysis and factor insight.

Each milestone in the roadmap builds toward a scalable, intelligent prime analysis platform that harmonizes deterministic rules with adaptive AI. The progression ensures auditable ML deployment, forward-compatible design, and increasing scientific value across future tool versions.
