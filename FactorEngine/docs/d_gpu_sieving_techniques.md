# D. GPU Sieving Techniques

Ownership extends to CUDA-enabled performance models and kernel strategies, including:
• Batch distribution, memory coalescence, and occupancy maximization
• Hybrid CPU-GPU control flow logic for sieving and filtering integration
• Dynamic scaling models across single and multi-GPU architectures
