# E. Deployment & Integration Roadmap

The RL ranking system will be introduced in phases:
• Phase 1 – Simulated policy learning on benchmark dataset logs
• Phase 2 – Batch reordering trials in symbolic/ML exclusion stages
• Phase 3 – Real-time feedback loop with latency-aware rewards
• Phase 4 – Full integration into PrimeEngineAI's candidate routing controller

This staged approach ensures stability, auditability, and controllable adoption of reinforcement-guided candidate ranking.

By incorporating reinforcement learning into the symbolic candidate ranking process, PrimeEngineAI introduces a scalable, data-driven mechanism for improving pipeline efficiency. The RL framework enhances throughput, reduces wasteful computation, and continuously adapts to the shifting dynamics of large-scale prime discovery.
