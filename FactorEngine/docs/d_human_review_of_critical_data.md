# D. Human Review of Critical Data

All major prime discoveries, symbolic rule proposals, and machine learning rule updates undergo manual review before being committed to production. Reviewers validate:
• Mathematical proof chains (for ECPP-confirmed primes)
• Symbolic pattern generality and composite specificity
• Data cleanliness and reproducibility prior to ML retraining

This ensures interpretability, peer credibility, and protection against biased ML-induced symbolic drift.

Together, these measures form a robust, multi-tiered protocol for safeguarding the scientific and commercial integrity of PrimeEngineAI's proprietary data. They enable confidence in both public reporting and internal ML development cycles, while supporting future validation by academic or industry stakeholders.
