# A. Rising Demand for Larger Primes in Cryptographic Applications

As post-quantum cryptographic planning advances and classical key lengths continue to expand (2048-bit to 8192-bit RSA), there is increasing pressure on infrastructure to:
• Generate large, unpredictable primes
• Validate them with deterministic or probabilistic rigor
• Ensure mathematical transparency and compliance for key exchanges

PrimeEngineAI directly supports this trend with scalable discovery pipelines, ML-assisted filtering, and transparent logging.
