# B. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Role

RL is used to introduce long-term strategic optimization into the pipeline. Unlike ML, which learns from static labeled data, RL continuously improves filtering strategy and stage routing by using reward feedback. RL is designed to:
• Adjust symbolic rule scoring weights based on long-term success/failure rates.
• Optimize batch prioritization based on expected prime yield.
• Balance computational load by learning when to escalate or delay deeper validation stages.
• Enable autonomous tuning of dynamic filters in the absence of human intervention.
