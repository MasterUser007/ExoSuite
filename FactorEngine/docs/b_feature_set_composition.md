# B. Feature Set Composition

Key features extracted from each candidate include:
• Terminal digit patterns (e.g., ends in 0, 2, 5)
• Modulo residue patterns (n mod p for small primes)
• Symbolic cache tier match counts
• Frequency of exclusion by rule family (e.g., repeat digit, mirrored patterns)
• Weighted heuristic score from symbolic and remainder layers

These features are designed to highlight subtle correlations not captured by deterministic symbolic rules alone.
