# A. Machine Learning (ML) Role

ML is primarily used to refine the symbolic exclusion process by learning statistical correlations between candidate traits and filter outcomes. It functions as a high-speed probabilistic classifier that can:
• Identify subtle, non-obvious patterns in numeric structures that correlate with composite or prime likelihood.
• Reduce over-reliance on fixed symbolic rules that may underperform across digit classes or edge cases.
• Produce exclusion confidence scores that can be used to route candidates to the optimal next step (symbolic, GPU, or primality test).
• Retrain dynamically using historical results, allowing adaptation to new numeric patterns.
