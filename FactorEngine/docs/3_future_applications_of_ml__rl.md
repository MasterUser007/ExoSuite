# 3. Future Applications of ML & RL

The modular AI infrastructure in PrimeEngineAI lays the groundwork for progressively advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) capabilities. These enhancements are designed to optimize symbolic filtering, accelerate candidate triage, and eventually support intelligent decision-making in factoring and exclusion logic. Each of the following proposed features builds upon existing telemetry, symbolic logs, and filter architecture.
