# Phase 4–5 – Proprietary Data Licensing

As the internal dataset grows, PrimeEngineAI will monetize symbolic filters, benchmark logs, and prime validation registries:
• High-value proprietary prime datasets for cryptography or academic licensing
• Symbolic rule efficacy archives for ML or filtering research
• Prime gap closure registries for number theory institutions
• On-demand access options (one-time licensing) or data-as-a-service (DaaS) subscriptions

This revenue stream leverages the system’s unique data asset and knowledge advantage.
