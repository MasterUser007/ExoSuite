# D. Edge-Case Tests

These tests validate system behavior in rare or extreme scenarios, including:
• Highly composite numbers (e.g., factorials, known Carmichael numbers).
• Primes located at the start or end of large candidate batches.
• Corrupted inputs or invalid digit sequences.
• Extremely small or large batch sizes.

These conditions help harden the system against unexpected failure, overflow behavior, or unhandled exceptions.
