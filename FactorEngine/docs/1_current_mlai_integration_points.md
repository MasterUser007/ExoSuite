# 1. Current ML/AI Integration Points

PrimeEngineAI is designed with a modular architecture that is forward-compatible with Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems. These intelligent modules are strategically positioned to enhance filtering accuracy, adapt rule prioritization, and evolve decision logic without disrupting the deterministic core pipeline. The integration points are explicitly defined to allow rapid innovation while maintaining full system transparency.
