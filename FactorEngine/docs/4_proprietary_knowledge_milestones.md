# 4. Proprietary Knowledge Milestones

PrimeEngineAIâ€™s long-term defensibility and competitive advantage are driven by the continuous accumulation of proprietary knowledge. This knowledge is systematized into quantifiable milestones that track the evolution of prime discovery, filtering precision, symbolic logic refinement, and validation reliability. These milestones are tied directly to R&D deliverables, ML model improvement, and commercial dataset licensing opportunities.
