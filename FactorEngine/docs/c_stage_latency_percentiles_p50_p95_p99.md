# C. Stage Latency Percentiles (p50, p95, p99)

Latency is measured at each pipeline stage and reported using percentile metrics. This includes p50 (median), p95 (tail), and p99 (extreme outlier) timings. These values help profile consistency, detect irregularities in compute load, and optimize caching and batch configurations. Percentile latency benchmarks are especially valuable in performance-sensitive deployments such as real-time key generation or research-grade workloads.
