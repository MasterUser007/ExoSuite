# A. Cryptography and Cybersecurity

Modern encryption relies on large prime numbers for secure key generation in algorithms such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve cryptography. PrimeEngineAI:
• Accelerates prime candidate testing for real-time key generation
• Provides traceable prime validation for regulatory compliance
• Reduces cryptographic setup time through early symbolic exclusions

This enhances both security posture and operational efficiency for cryptography providers.
