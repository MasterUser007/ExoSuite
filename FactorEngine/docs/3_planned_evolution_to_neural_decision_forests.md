# 3. Planned Evolution to Neural Decision Forests

As PrimeEngineAIâ€™s symbolic filtering models mature, the machine learning architecture will transition from simple decision trees to more expressive and adaptable frameworks. The primary upgrade pathway involves adopting a Neural Decision Forest (NDF) approach, which blends the transparency of decision trees with the representational power of neural networks. This hybrid model will enable more accurate filtering of complex and ambiguous candidate structures, especially in higher digit classes and edge-case numeric regions.
