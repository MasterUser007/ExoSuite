# C. Reproducing Filtering Outcomes Using Sample Sets

PrimeEngineAI provides hashed subsets of candidate data and matching test scripts that enable auditors to:
• Replay symbolic filtering decisions.
• Measure exclusion accuracy and throughput.
• Compare ML prediction outcomes against recorded hashes.

Scripts are delivered in containerized form (Docker) to ensure reproducibility and version consistency across environments.
