# 7. ML Roadmap Milestones

PrimeEngineAIâ€™s machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) roadmap outlines a staged progression from lightweight classifiers to deeply integrated AI modules that enhance filtering, prioritization, and eventual factoring assistance. Each milestone builds upon validated outcomes, publicly benchmarked performance, and modular extensibility designed into the current pipeline. The roadmap spans four major deliverables from 2025 through 2027.
