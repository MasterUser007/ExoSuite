# E. Cloud Deployment Ready

PrimeEngineAI is packaged using containerized Docker deployments and can be provisioned using AWS Terraform automation scripts. This allows the entire system to be deployed elastically in cloud environments, auto-scaling compute nodes as needed. The modular containers also support horizontal scaling of GPU sieving or primality validation clusters.
