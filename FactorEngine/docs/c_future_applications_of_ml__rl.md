# C. Future Applications of ML & RL

Planned expansions include:
• RL-based symbolic rule scoring and exclusion prioritization.
• Statistical anomaly detection for symbolic logic regressions.
• Composite complexity estimators to support factoring heuristics.
• Automated symbolic pattern generation from clustering analytics.

The modular, non-invasive AI design within PrimeEngineAI enables a hybrid strategy that combines deterministic filtering rigor with adaptive intelligence. This ensures continuous optimization, minimal false discovery, and long-term scalability in candidate discovery.
