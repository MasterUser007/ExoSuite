# D. Prometheus Metrics & Telemetry

The tool supports native Prometheus metrics for real-time monitoring, performance tracing, and health checks. Operators can inspect latency per stage, memory usage, error rates, and throughput to identify bottlenecks or regression. This level of observability supports scientific benchmarking and enterprise-level production deployments.
