# B. RL-Driven Prioritization of Search Regions

Reinforcement Learning will be used to optimize which numeric regions should be searched or filtered first. Using historical yield data, the system will associate high-reward scores with candidate batches or digit classes that have a higher density of probable primes. Over time, this allows the engine to avoid prime-sparse regions and focus computational power where success rates are highest. The RL policy will evolve continuously based on live feedback from candidate outcomes.
