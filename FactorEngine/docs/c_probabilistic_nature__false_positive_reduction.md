# C. Probabilistic Nature & False Positive Reduction

Although not conclusive on its own, the layer significantly lowers false positives. It identifies subtle traits statistically correlated with compositeness based on prior observations and symbolic history. By operating at nearly the same speed as symbolic cache lookups, this analysis provides a very high cost-to-value ratio, filtering candidates with minimal computational overhead.
