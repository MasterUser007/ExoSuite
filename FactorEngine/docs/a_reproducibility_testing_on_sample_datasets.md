# A. Reproducibility Testing on Sample Datasets

The toolkit allows external researchers and auditors to re-run pipeline operations on open benchmark datasets. Each dataset includes known prime/composite classifications, expected filter outcomes, and canonical test inputs. Validators can confirm whether the tool produces consistent results with respect to candidate pass/fail classification and performance metrics.
