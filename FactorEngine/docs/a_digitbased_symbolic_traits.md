# A. Digit-Based Symbolic Traits

Common composite traits are easily identifiable in base-10 notation. For example, numbers ending in '0', '2', '4', '5', '6', or '8' can immediately be ruled out. Likewise, candidates with repetitive digit structures like '222', '4444', or alternating patterns such as '1212' are often structurally composite. These properties are encoded as symbolic templates that can be applied via lightweight bitmask operations.
