# 2. ML & RL Role in PrimeEngineAI

Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) play distinct but complementary roles in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and scalability of the PrimeEngineAI candidate evaluation pipeline. These intelligent layers supplement symbolic logic by applying data-driven insights and long-term optimization techniques to better predict and prioritize promising numerical candidates.
