# B. False Positive Rate (Target: < 0.1%)

This metric tracks the number of composite numbers that are incorrectly passed as probable primes. A low false positive rate is essential for accuracy and efficiency, especially when pipeline resources are limited. PrimeEngineAI maintains this rate under 0.1% across all probabilistic layers, including Millerâ€“Rabin and symbolic filtering.
