# B. Benefits Compared to Classical Decision Trees

The move from standard decision trees to NDFs offers several advantages:
• Improved precision on ambiguous or edge-case inputs.
• Enhanced robustness to symbolic feature noise or high-dimensional representations.
• Better integration with reinforcement learning reward signals.
• Retention of interpretability through visualizable decision paths and routing probabilities.

NDFs also support end-to-end differentiability, making them more suitable for future GPU-accelerated training pipelines.
