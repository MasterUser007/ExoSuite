# B. Q4 2025 – Reinforcement Learning Symbolic Ranking Prototype

The RL symbolic prioritization system will be prototyped to determine optimal ordering and selection strategies for candidate evaluation. This system will:
• Learn prioritization strategies from candidate histories and exclusion success metrics
• Implement reward functions tied to early exclusion and throughput efficiency
• Support batch-level RL policy trials under simulated and live conditions

It will represent the first integration of adaptive long-term learning into the PrimeEngineAI symbolic routing logic.
