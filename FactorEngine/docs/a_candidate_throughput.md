# A. Candidate Throughput

Each stage reports the number of candidates it processes per second. This helps identify bottlenecks and verify that symbolic filters, sieves, and testing layers are scaling efficiently. Throughput data is often segmented by digit range, cache hit ratios, or GPU workload batch size for detailed performance tracing.
