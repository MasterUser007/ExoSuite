# Phase 4 – SaaS Subscription Access

As the platform matures, PrimeEngineAI will launch a cloud-hosted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with tiered access:
• Monthly and annual subscription pricing
• Tiered plans based on compute usage, symbolic cache access, and ML model features
• RESTful API access for DevOps integration into finance, cryptography, and research platforms
• Admin dashboards and Prometheus-based usage reporting for enterprise compliance

This model offers scalability, ease of access, and recurring revenue consistency.
