Q: How does symbolic filtering work?
A: Digit patterns, modulo cycles, and heuristics are applied to eliminate obvious composites before resource-intensive testing.

Q: What is symbolic cache compression?
A: Composite eliminations are collapsed into symbolic rules, reducing storage needs and increasing speed, approaching Kolmogorov complexity limits.

Q: How does GPU sieving enhance performance?
A: CUDA sieving batches candidate elimination across GPUs, enabling high-throughput parallel filtering.

Q: Is the ML/AI functionality active?
A: ML hooks are fully integrated. ML-based rule refinement and RL ranking are roadmap priorities.
