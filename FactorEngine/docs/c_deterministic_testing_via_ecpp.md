# C. Deterministic Testing via ECPP

For numbers exceeding 200 digits, PrimeEngineAI invokes the Elliptic Curve Primality Proving (ECPP) algorithm. Unlike Millerâ€“Rabin, ECPP is a deterministic method that proves primality with full mathematical rigor. ECPP is especially valuable for applications requiring formal certification of primality, such as cryptographic key generation and academic verification of large prime discoveries.
