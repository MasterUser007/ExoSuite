# A. Public Benchmark Dataset Release

The benchmark release will include a curated suite of prime and composite candidates across a wide range of digit lengths (from 50 to over 1000 digits). Each record will contain metadata detailing symbolic filter outcomes, cache hits, false-positive flags, stage-by-stage latency logs, and final primality verdicts. The dataset will be open-sourced for community testing, with licensing terms aligned to academic and non-commercial use.
