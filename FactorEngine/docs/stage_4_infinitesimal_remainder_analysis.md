# Stage 4: Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis

For candidates passing earlier stages, PrimeEngineAI applies a lightweight probabilistic filter known as Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis. This method evaluates candidates against a range of small primes and symbolic remainders (n mod p) to identify hidden compositeness traits. Candidates with marginal residual behavior or structural imbalance are flagged and deprioritized. This step sharpens the candidate pool, ensuring only statistically promising numbers move forward to more expensive validation.
