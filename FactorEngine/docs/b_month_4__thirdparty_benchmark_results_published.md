# B. Month 4 – Third-Party Benchmark Results Published

Independent academic partners will replicate PrimeEngineAI’s performance benchmarks, focusing on:
• Candidate throughput across digit ranges
• Filtering efficiency by stage (symbolic, sieve, probabilistic)
• False positive and false negative rates

These results will be published with hash-verified datasets and execution logs, ensuring reproducibility and independent verification.
