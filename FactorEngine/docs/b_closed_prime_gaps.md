# B. Closed Prime Gaps

When PrimeEngineAI resolves a numeric interval previously unconfirmed to contain consecutive primes, it contributes:
• Verified gap boundary metadata
• Symbolic and probabilistic trait logs for adjacent numbers
• Confidence estimates and filtering efficiency stats

This data enriches the historical record of prime distributions and informs heuristic rules for region-specific filtering optimization.
