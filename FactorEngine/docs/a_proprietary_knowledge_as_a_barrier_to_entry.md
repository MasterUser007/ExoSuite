# A. Proprietary Knowledge as a Barrier to Entry

At the core of PrimeEngineAI’s defensibility is its proprietary dataset—continuously enriched through symbolic rule evaluations, candidate scoring logs, and closed prime gap confirmations. This knowledge base:
• Enables symbolic rule generalization and ML filter tuning
• Cannot be replicated from public sources or legacy systems
• Embeds compounding technical depth into every system iteration

The result is a self-advancing moat that resists commoditization and one-off duplication.
