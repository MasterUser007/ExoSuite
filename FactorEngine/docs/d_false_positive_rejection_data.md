# D. False Positive Rejection Data

Any time a composite candidate is misclassified or prematurely advanced, PrimeEngineAI logs the symbolic, ML, and remainder layer features associated with the error. This provides a high-value training signal for:
• ML model refinement
• Anomaly detection routines
• Symbolic template enhancement

These logs form a corrective loop that improves pipeline precision with each cycle.
