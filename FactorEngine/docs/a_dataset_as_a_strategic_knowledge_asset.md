# A. Dataset as a Strategic Knowledge Asset

The dataset grows with each pipeline run and includes:
• Symbolic exclusion outcomes
• Prime confirmations and closed gap metadata
• False positive and composite error traces
• Remainder analysis logs

This accumulation of empirical filtering and validation events forms a proprietary knowledge base unavailable to open-source or legacy systems. It drives continual improvement of symbolic logic, supports ML retraining, and reduces filtering latency.
