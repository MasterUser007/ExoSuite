# 4. Cloud Scalability

PrimeEngineAI is designed with a flexible, deployment-agnostic architecture that supports a wide range of runtime environments, from local development machines to cloud-scale compute clusters. Its containerized and infrastructure-as-code design ensures that the same core system can be run reliably across single-node setups, GPU-enabled machines, and globally distributed platforms without reconfiguration. This scalability underpins PrimeEngineAIâ€™s ability to adapt to evolving research, enterprise, and high-performance computing needs.
