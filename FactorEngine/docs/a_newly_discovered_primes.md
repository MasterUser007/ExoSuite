# A. Newly Discovered Primes

Each newly verified prime number—particularly at high digit scales—is recorded with metadata including:
• Digit length and class
• Filtering and validation sequence
• Symbolic exclusion success path
• Processing time and stage latency

These discoveries serve as ground truth for benchmarking symbolic filters, calibrating ML scoring models, and validating system reliability.
