# D. Tunable Application Thresholds

PrimeEngineAI allows configurable thresholds for when and how aggressively Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis is applied. In high-throughput environments, it may be set to operate on every candidate; in latency-sensitive contexts, it can be bypassed in favor of direct symbolic/GPU testing. This flexibility ensures the layer adapts to available compute capacity, desired accuracy, and real-time workload pressure.
