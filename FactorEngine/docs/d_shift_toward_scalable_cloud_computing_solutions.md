# D. Shift Toward Scalable Cloud Computing Solutions

Enterprise, government, and academic organizations are moving away from siloed desktop computation toward:
• Cloud-native, GPU-enabled processing frameworks
• Distributed workload balancing for mathematical research
• On-demand benchmarking and test containerization

PrimeEngineAI's container-based design (Docker, Terraform, Prometheus integration) directly maps to this paradigm.
