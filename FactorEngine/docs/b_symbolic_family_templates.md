# B. Symbolic Family Templates

To scale these exclusions, PrimeEngineAI organizes known composite patterns into symbolic families. Each family generalizes a pattern into a classâ€”for instance, the 'Terminal 5' family includes all numbers ending in 5, while the 'Repeating Digit' family includes any number with a digit repeated more than N times in a row. These family templates allow batch exclusion of entire classes of numbers in a single rule pass.
