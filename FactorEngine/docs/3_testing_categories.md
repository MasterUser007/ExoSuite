# 3. Testing Categories

PrimeEngineAI implements a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the correctness, robustness, and performance of each subsystem. The testing framework includes unit, integration, performance, and edge-case validations. This approach guarantees that both core mathematical operations and full pipeline executions behave predictably under a wide range of input conditions and workloads.
