# A. Third-Party Validation of Benchmark Results (Q3 2025)

PrimeEngineAI will undergo structured third-party validation through academic and industry-aligned cryptographic institutions. These validators will:
• Independently reproduce pipeline execution with public datasets
• Compare symbolic exclusion results, false positive rates, and throughput to PrimeEngineAI’s published benchmarks
• Publish findings or submit reports aligned with reproducibility and credibility standards

This ensures measurable external confirmation of PrimeEngineAI’s technical claims and competitive standing.
