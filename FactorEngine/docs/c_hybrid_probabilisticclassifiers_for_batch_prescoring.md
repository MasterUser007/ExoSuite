# C. Hybrid Probabilistic-Classifiers for Batch Pre-Scoring

A hybrid model combining ML-based scoring and symbolic logic will be introduced to evaluate candidate batches in parallel. These classifiers will pre-score batches before symbolic or GPU-based filtering to:
• Flag obviously weak candidates early
• Prioritize likely prime-rich candidates for deeper validation
• Minimize time spent on non-viable number ranges

This integration reduces unnecessary computation while increasing pipeline focus.
