# B. Dynamic Batch Scaling

The system includes dynamic tuning of batch sizes and processing workloads. Both CPU threads and GPU kernels can be scaled independently per pipeline stage, based on available system resources or cloud deployment targets. This ensures PrimeEngineAI remains efficient across a variety of computing environments, from high-performance workstations to distributed cloud GPU clusters.
