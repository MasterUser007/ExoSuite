# Stage 2: Cache Lookup

The system then performs a lookup against a dynamically updated symbolic cache. This cache stores previously filtered composite structures, known non-prime digit traits, and modular remainders derived from earlier filtering rounds. By storing composite patterns and reapplying them efficiently, the cache reduces redundant computation and accelerates throughput in real-time processing environments. This layer supports tiered exclusions based on confidence scores and recurrence frequency.
