# D. Audit Trails Supporting Cryptanalysis and Commercial Use

Because PrimeEngineAI logs every decision path—including exclusions, ML predictions, symbolic rule hits, and final verdicts—it provides an immutable audit trail. This traceability ensures:
• Compliance with academic standards of reproducibility
• Verifiability of composite complexity scores used in risk assessments
• Trust for commercial or cryptanalysis-grade factoring use

Combined with its hashing and timestamping protocols, the dataset becomes a commercial-grade cryptanalytic foundation.

As PrimeEngineAI transitions from primality verification to composite factor analysis, its proprietary dataset offers unmatched depth, validation rigor, and strategic advantage. The AI factoring engine built atop this foundation will deliver scalable, intelligent, and audit-ready capabilities for the next era of computational number theory and applied cryptography.
