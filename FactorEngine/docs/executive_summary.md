# Executive Summary

PrimeEngineAI revolutionizes scalable prime number discovery through a modular, high-performance computational engine integrating symbolic cache filtering, GPU-accelerated sieving, GMP-backed primality testing, and future-ready machine learning integration.

Key Features & Advantages:

Symbolic Filtering & Truncation: Rapid exclusion of obvious composites, reducing compute overhead.

GPU-Accelerated Sieving: High-throughput CUDA processing for candidate filtering.

Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis: Lightweight heuristic filtering before heavy primality tests.

GMP Miller-Rabin Testing: Industry-standard probabilistic primality checks.

Modular Design: Easy integration, testing, and future scaling.

ML/AI Hooks (Planned): Infrastructure ready for RL/ML-driven symbolic rule optimization.

Cloud-Ready Deployment: Terraform automation and Docker containers for AWS scaling.

Comprehensive Testing: Full unit and performance test coverage with edge-case validation.
