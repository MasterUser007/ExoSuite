# C. Performance Tests

Performance testing benchmarks candidate throughput, stage latency, and compute efficiency under variable loads. These tests run on GPU-accelerated and CPU-only configurations to produce reference metrics across different hardware profiles. Results are logged in Prometheus-compatible format for analysis and regression tracking.
