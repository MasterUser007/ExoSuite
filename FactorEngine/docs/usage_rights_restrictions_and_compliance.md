# Usage Rights, Restrictions, and Compliance

Each license explicitly defines:
• Scope of use (research, production, OEM, SaaS)
• Redistribution limitations
• Symbolic rule export protections
• Reproducibility obligations (for academic results)
• Restrictions on commercial resale of derived outputs

Unauthorized use, redistribution, sublicensing, or creation of derivative works based on PrimeEngineAI’s proprietary content is strictly prohibited and subject to enforcement through contractual and legal means.

These licensing structures protect PrimeEngineAI’s intellectual property while providing scalable pathways for academic, commercial, and embedded adoption. Licensees are expected to uphold usage ethics, data confidentiality, and compliance with defined IP boundaries.
