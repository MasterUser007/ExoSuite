# Phase 3 – Consulting and Custom Software Licensing

In this phase, monetization is driven by bespoke implementations, direct enterprise engagements, and controlled deployments. Offerings include:
• Strategic consulting for cryptographic agencies, fintech firms, and research institutions
• Custom deployment support (on-premises, air-gapped, GPU-optimized clusters)
• Perpetual or annual software licenses priced by tier (number of users, GPU cores, or runtime batch volume)
• White-label opportunities for private-label integrations or platform resale

This phase captures early adopters requiring high control and integration fidelity.
