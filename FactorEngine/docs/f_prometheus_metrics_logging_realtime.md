# F. Prometheus Metrics Logging (Real-Time)

All metrics are exported in Prometheus-compatible format with live time series output. Each entry is timestamped and tagged by pipeline stage, digit class, and node. This allows for integration with Grafana dashboards, system alerts, and historical audit snapshots.

Collectively, these metrics form the backbone of PrimeEngineAIâ€™s observability layer, supporting auditability, tuning, and future reinforcement learning based on pipeline outcomes.
