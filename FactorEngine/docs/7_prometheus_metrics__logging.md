# 7. Prometheus Metrics & Logging

PrimeEngineAI is engineered with observability and diagnostics at its core. Each pipeline stage emits a rich set of real-time performance metrics. These metrics are essential not only for system optimization and scaling but also for scientific reproducibility, benchmark validation, and operational transparency. The telemetry system supports Prometheus integration, JSON exports, and performance dashboards.
