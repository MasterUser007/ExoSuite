# A. Core Performance Metrics

The benchmarking framework continuously measures the following performance dimensions:
• Candidate Throughput – The number of numeric candidates evaluated per second per stage.
• False Positive/Negative Rates – Accuracy tracking for symbolic filtering, probabilistic tests, and final primality validation.
• Latency – Median (p50), tail (p95), and worst-case (p99) response time per stage.
• Resource Utilization – Real-time CPU/GPU usage, memory footprint, and concurrency saturation.
