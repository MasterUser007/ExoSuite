# A. New Prime Discoveries – Target: 10,000+ by Year 3

PrimeEngineAI targets over 10,000 verified large-digit prime discoveries by the end of Year 3. Each discovery is:
• Hash-stamped and timestamped with full traceability
• Logged alongside symbolic rule path and candidate metadata
• Added to a reproducible validation dataset with digit-length categorization

These discoveries serve as evidence of symbolic filter efficacy and are monetizable as cryptographic validation assets.
