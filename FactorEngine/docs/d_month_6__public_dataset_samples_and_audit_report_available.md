# D. Month 6 – Public Dataset Samples and Audit Report Available

To ensure transparency while protecting IP, PrimeEngineAI will:
• Release redacted benchmark datasets with reproducibility scripts
• Provide hashed symbolic filter logs for closed candidate runs
• Publish a formal audit report validated by an independent third party

This allows reviewers to validate outcomes without compromising symbolic logic IP.
