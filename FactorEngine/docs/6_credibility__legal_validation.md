# 6. Credibility & Legal Validation

To reinforce the credibility, enforceability, and legal defensibility of the PrimeEngineAI platform, all aspects of data integrity, intellectual property protection, and commercial licensing have undergone review by independent legal counsel. This includes validation of proprietary dataset handling, IP ownership structures, and licensing frameworks. In addition, the platformâ€™s scientific and operational claims are anchored in transparent external audit pathways for licensed users and advisors.
