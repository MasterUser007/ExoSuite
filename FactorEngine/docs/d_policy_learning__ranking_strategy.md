# D. Policy Learning & Ranking Strategy

The RL agent maintains and evolves a policy network that maps symbolic metadata to candidate prioritization scores. These scores are used to rank batch elements dynamically, allowing the most promising candidates to move forward first, while low-scoring entries are deprioritized or re-routed. The policy is continuously updated based on batch-level feedback, and can be trained in simulation or live deployment modes.
