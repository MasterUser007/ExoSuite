# D. Training and Evolution Roadmap

The transition to Neural Decision Forests will be phased in as follows:
• Phase 1 – Prototype implementation using TensorFlow or PyTorch, trained on historical v1 model datasets.
• Phase 2 – Side-by-side deployment for validation against current decision tree models.
• Phase 3 – Reinforcement loop integration for dynamic routing optimization.
• Phase 4 – GPU-accelerated, fully modular deployment within PrimeEngineAI’s inference pipeline.

This roadmap ensures reproducibility, testability, and auditability throughout the model evolution.

By evolving toward Neural Decision Forests, PrimeEngineAI will significantly enhance its symbolic filtering capabilities while maintaining its commitment to transparency, modularity, and reproducibility. This hybrid model approach enables more accurate, scalable, and intelligent filtering decisions across a wide spectrum of numeric candidates.
