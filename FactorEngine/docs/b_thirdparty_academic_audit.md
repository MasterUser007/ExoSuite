# B. Third-Party Academic Audit

Following the benchmark release, an independent academic audit will be conducted by one or more university-affiliated mathematics departments. This review will examine:
• Filtering effectiveness and symbolic exclusion accuracy.
• False positive/negative rates across pipeline stages.
• Reproducibility of published benchmarks under cold-start and randomized conditions.
• Comparative verification of Miller–Rabin and ECPP outputs.

Audit findings will be published in both peer-reviewed and preprint formats.
