# A. What Are Neural Decision Forests?

Neural Decision Forests are a family of models that unify the decision-making logic of tree-based classifiers with the differentiability and expressiveness of neural networks. Instead of hard, binary splits at each tree node, NDFs use learned soft routing functions that allow multiple paths to contribute to a final prediction. This results in smoother decision boundaries and better generalization to noisy or nonlinear data distributions.
