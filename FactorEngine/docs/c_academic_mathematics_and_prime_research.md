# C. Academic Mathematics and Prime Research

Academic and applied number theorists require scalable tools to:
• Explore prime distribution in large ranges
• Study conjectures (e.g., Goldbach, twin primes, prime gaps)
• Benchmark symbolic exclusion methods across digit classes

PrimeEngineAI provides:
• Verifiable test logs
• Configurable stage pipelines for algorithm experimentation
• Access to high-performance compute-grade discovery tools
