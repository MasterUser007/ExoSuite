# A. Regular Testing Suite Updates

PrimeEngineAIâ€™s test framework is regularly updated to align with changes in hardware (e.g., new CPU/GPU architectures), software libraries (e.g., GMP, CUDA, NumPy), and symbolic exclusion logic. These updates include regression tests to prevent reintroducing prior bugs, compatibility validations across OS versions, and automated verifications for new ML-based filters or cache tiering logic. By integrating version-aware testing, the tool maintains consistency and performance across all supported environments.
