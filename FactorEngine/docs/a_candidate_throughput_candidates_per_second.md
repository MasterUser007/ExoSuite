# A. Candidate Throughput (Candidates per Second)

This metric indicates how many numerical candidates are processed per second by each stage of the pipeline. It helps identify system bottlenecks and serves as a baseline efficiency measurement. Throughput is also segmented by digit range and candidate origin type (random, structured, cached).
