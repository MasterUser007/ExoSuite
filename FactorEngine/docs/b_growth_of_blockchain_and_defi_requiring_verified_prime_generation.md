# B. Growth of Blockchain and DeFi Requiring Verified Prime Generation

Decentralized finance and blockchain consensus mechanisms increasingly rely on:
• Verifiable random number generation
• Secure signature schemes (e.g., BLS, RSA variants)
• Prime-based validator key generation and protocol-level randomness

PrimeEngineAI’s low-latency prime verification and deterministic replay capabilities are a strong fit for both on-chain and off-chain crypto systems.
