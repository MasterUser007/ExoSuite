# C. Newly Discovered Primes

When PrimeEngineAI confirms a new prime through its Millerâ€“Rabin or ECPP layer, the full trace of the candidate is logged and included in training sets. These include structural features, filter outcomes, residue patterns, and latency metrics. New prime discoveries provide highly valuable positive class examples for both scoring optimization and symbolic classifier training.
