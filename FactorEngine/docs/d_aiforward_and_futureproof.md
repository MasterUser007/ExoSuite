# D. AI-Forward and Future-Proof

With a symbolic filtering backbone and a continuously retrainable ML interface, PrimeEngineAI is prepared to:
• Transition from supervised filtering to unsupervised symbolic generation
• Implement RL agents that self-tune search pathways
• Support intelligent factoring via dataset-driven heuristic discovery

The roadmap includes AI-native modeling for prime distribution estimation, factoring prediction, and cryptographic protocol evaluation.

PrimeEngineAI’s long-term vision positions it as more than a tool—it is a platform that adapts to emerging mathematical, computational, and cryptographic frontiers. It is built to grow in relevance, capability, and market value with each dataset, hardware improvement, and algorithmic refinement.
