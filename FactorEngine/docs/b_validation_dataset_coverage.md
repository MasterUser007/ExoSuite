# B. Validation Dataset Coverage

A comprehensive validation dataset—composed of confirmed primes, composites, pseudoprimes, and edge cases—is used to test the accuracy of symbolic filters, probabilistic heuristics, and deterministic tests. Every major update must pass validation against this dataset. Symbolic logic changes are benchmarked against known traps such as Carmichael numbers and digit mirror patterns to ensure false negatives are minimized and filter precision remains intact.
