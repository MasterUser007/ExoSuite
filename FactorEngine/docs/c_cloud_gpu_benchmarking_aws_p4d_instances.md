# C. Cloud GPU Benchmarking (AWS p4d Instances)

To validate PrimeEngineAIâ€™s scalability in elastic environments, benchmarking is also conducted on AWS p4d instances. These nodes offer multi-GPU configurations with high-throughput interconnects, making them ideal for testing horizontal GPU scaling and distributed candidate batch processing. Benchmarking on AWS includes latency comparisons across nodes, cloud-init parallelism tuning, and Docker-optimized orchestration under Terraform scripts.
