# A. Public Benchmark Datasets

The benchmark suite will include labeled candidate sets ranging from 50 to 1000 digits. These datasets will contain both confirmed primes and known composites with metadata including digit class, filter stage outcome, and validation timestamps. This will allow independent researchers to validate filter efficiency, false positive/negative rates, and comparative pipeline throughput.
