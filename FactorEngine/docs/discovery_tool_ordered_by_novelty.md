# Discovery Tool: Ordered by Novelty

This document details all the innovative ideas employed in the design of the Symbolic Prime Discovery Tool, ordered from the most novel to the most common innovations. Each idea is explained in terms of its role, uniqueness, and contribution to the overall tool design. The tool achieves computational efficiency by constant, layered pruning of invalid candidates, progressively narrowing the search space before any computationally expensive tests are applied.
