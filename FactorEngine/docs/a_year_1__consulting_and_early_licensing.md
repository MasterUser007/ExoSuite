# A. Year 1 – Consulting and Early Licensing

The first year focuses on foundational revenue through:
• Strategic consulting engagements with cryptography firms and academic groups
• Custom deployments (air-gapped systems, private clusters)
• Pilot licensing programs targeting symbolic filter evaluation, benchmark replication, and early prime discovery acceleration

These activities validate the tool in production settings, build use-case documentation, and establish key reference clients.
