# D. Cache Pruning Algorithms

To avoid memory bloat and ensure speed, PrimeEngineAI employs cache pruning algorithms that remove outdated, redundant, or ineffective symbolic filters. These pruning routines monitor hit/miss ratios and composite exclusion success rates. Rules that fall below efficiency thresholds are archived or discarded, keeping the symbolic cache lean and performant.
