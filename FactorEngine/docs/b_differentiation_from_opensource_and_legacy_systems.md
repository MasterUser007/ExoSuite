# B. Differentiation from Open-Source and Legacy Systems

Where open-source tools rely on fixed mathematical rules and legacy systems emphasize CPU-bound brute force, PrimeEngineAI introduces:
• Multi-layered symbolic filters augmented by adaptive ML classifiers
• GPU-accelerated sieving and remainder analysis
• RL-driven candidate prioritization and symbolic scoring optimization

This hybrid architecture delivers superior speed, precision, and extensibility—distinguishing it from stagnant alternatives.
