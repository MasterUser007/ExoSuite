# 1. MVP Algorithm Description

The PrimeEngineAI MVP implements a high-efficiency, layered algorithm for prime number discovery, incorporating:

Symbolic Filtering & Truncation Logic: Rapid bitmask checks on digit patterns to exclude obvious composite candidates at the earliest possible stage. This reduces computational overhead and focuses resources on plausible prime candidates.

GPU-Accelerated Sieving: High-throughput CUDA kernels execute candidate filtering at scale. Dynamic batching adjusts to available GPU resources and candidate set size, enabling efficient scaling from local GPUs to distributed cloud compute environments.

Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis: A proprietary heuristic layer applying lightweight divisibility tests and digit-pattern filtering. While not mathematically infinitesimal in the calculus sense, this layer eliminates composite candidates using minimal computational overhead.

GMP Miller-Rabin Testing: Industry-standard probabilistic primality checks using the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). The number of rounds and retry logging are configurable, and deterministic tests (ECPP) are applied for larger digit ranges.

Modular Design: Each pipeline layer operates independently and supports plugin-style rule injection. This allows isolated benchmarking, algorithm refinement, and minimal compute overhead during final tests.
