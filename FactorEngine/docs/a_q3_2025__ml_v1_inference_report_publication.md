# A. Q3 2025 – ML v1 Inference Report Publication

The first official publication will document the performance, accuracy, and integration results of the v1 symbolic filtering classifier. This report will include:
• Precision/recall results by digit class
• False positive and false negative rates under various workloads
• Feature importance rankings for symbolic exclusion
• Public benchmark logs and model hashes for audit validation

This milestone formalizes the transition from passive ML observation to production-grade inference support.
