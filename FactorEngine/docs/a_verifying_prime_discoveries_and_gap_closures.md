# A. Verifying Prime Discoveries and Gap Closures

Third parties can verify confirmed prime numbers and closed prime gaps by:
• Matching publicized candidates against published SHA-256 hash identifiers.
• Independently running deterministic primality tests (e.g., GMP Miller–Rabin or ECPP) on published candidates.
• Comparing gap boundaries with known historical gaps in academic databases.

This process allows independent confirmation of claims without revealing the full pipeline or internal heuristics.
