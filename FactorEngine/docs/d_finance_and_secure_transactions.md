# D. Finance and Secure Transactions

Financial systems increasingly use cryptographic protocols involving large primes to secure multi-party computations, tokenization, and secure messaging. PrimeEngineAI supports:
• Randomized prime generation for transaction masking
• Auditable trails for compliance-bound secure messaging frameworks
• High-frequency validation engines for internal financial networks
