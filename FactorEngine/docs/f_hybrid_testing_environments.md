# F. Hybrid Testing Environments

A key benefit of modular design is that any symbolic rule set, cache configuration, or candidate filtering strategy can be isolated and tested independently. Benchmark frameworks allow A/B testing of symbolic modules or exclusion heuristics before integrating them into the full pipeline. This encourages experimentation and continuous improvement without jeopardizing system stability.
