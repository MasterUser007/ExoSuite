# B. Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems

Zero-knowledge systems require prime numbers to underpin modular arithmetic operations. PrimeEngineAI:
• Improves proof generation speed by reducing filtering bottlenecks
• Enables fast, probabilistic prime validation for arithmetic circuits
• Supports prime-rich region targeting for recursive zk-STARK and zk-SNARK applications

Its utility is especially relevant in privacy-preserving systems and identity verification protocols.
