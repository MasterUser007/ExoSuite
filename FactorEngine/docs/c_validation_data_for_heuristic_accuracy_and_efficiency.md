# C. Validation Data for Heuristic Accuracy and Efficiency

Every filtering attempt—successful or not—is logged with outcome metadata and latency metrics. This enables:
• Measurement of how exclusion traits correlate with factoring difficulty
• Training of predictive models to score factoring success probability
• Feedback loops to adjust heuristics in real-time or across simulation iterations

These logs act as scientific validators for AI-generated heuristics, ensuring empirical support for optimization decisions.
