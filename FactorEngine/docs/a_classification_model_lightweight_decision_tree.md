# A. Classification Model: Lightweight Decision Tree

The v1 architecture uses a decision tree classifier due to its simplicity, transparency, and ability to handle mixed symbolic and numerical features. The tree structure enables easy visualization of decision paths and rule hierarchy. This also allows symbolic engineers to cross-reference decisions against rule logic for validation and tuning. Future versions may incorporate gradient-boosted trees or probabilistic ensembles, but v1 favors clarity.
