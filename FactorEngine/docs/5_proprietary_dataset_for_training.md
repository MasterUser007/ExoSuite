# 5. Proprietary Dataset for Training

The performance and adaptability of PrimeEngineAIâ€™s ML subsystems rely heavily on a proprietary, high-fidelity dataset generated through live pipeline execution, symbolic filtering logs, and primality validation feedback. This internal dataset serves as the backbone for training, evaluating, and continuously refining symbolic exclusion models, probabilistic classifiers, and reinforcement learning policies.
