# E. Hashed Logs and Symbolic Rule Protection

While validators are granted full visibility into sample datasets, performance outputs, and candidate verdicts, proprietary symbolic rules and exclusion caches remain encrypted and obfuscated. All filter outcomes are logged with SHA-256 hashes, allowing reproducibility and auditability without exposing trade-secret symbolic families.
