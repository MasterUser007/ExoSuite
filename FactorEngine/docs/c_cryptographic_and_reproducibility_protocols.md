# C. Cryptographic and Reproducibility Protocols

Every PrimeEngineAI benchmark and symbolic rule execution is logged with a reproducibility-first approach. This includes:
• SHA-256 hashing of all candidate datasets, symbolic outputs, and model inference results
• Immutable log storage of every test, cache hit, symbolic rule decision, and model revision
• Optional public sharing of Dockerized execution environments and model checkpoints

These steps enable:
• Forensic re-evaluation of candidate test decisions
• Public confidence in model behavior and logic path transparency
• Full reproducibility of published outcomes—without leaking proprietary symbolic filtering methods

With benchmark transparency, rigorous third-party auditing, and tamper-proof reproducibility workflows, PrimeEngineAI presents a new standard for trust in computational discovery. Its design ensures it is not only the most capable tool of its class but also the most credible—scientifically, operationally, and ethically.
