# C. retrain.py – Periodic Retraining Utility

This script automates the retraining of symbolic exclusion models by aggregating recent candidate evaluations. Capabilities include:
• Scheduling retraining cycles at configurable intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly, batch size-dependent)
• Filtering training data based on digit class, cache tier history, or ML prediction accuracy
• Generating versioned model outputs for performance comparison and rollback safety 
By continuously adapting to evolving numeric patterns and pipeline behavior, retrain.py ensures that ML filters stay current and effective.

These integration hooks form the foundation of PrimeEngineAI’s adaptive intelligence system. They allow researchers and engineers to deploy, retrain, and refine ML models in a modular fashion, without compromising the stability, transparency, or determinism of the core pipeline.
