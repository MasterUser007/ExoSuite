# B. Independent Academic Audits

To maintain impartiality and bolster credibility beyond self-reporting, PrimeEngineAI will undergo formal third-party academic audits. Partner institutions will:
• Independently reproduce published benchmarks and validate outcomes
• Audit symbolic exclusion accuracy using proprietary gap-closed datasets
• Confirm the integrity of exclusion rule results and candidate verdicts

Audits are timed with milestone releases and are intended to support future peer-reviewed publications and collaborative grant proposals. This third-party process ensures that all claims can withstand both academic and commercial scrutiny.
