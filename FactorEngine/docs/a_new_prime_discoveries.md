# A. New Prime Discoveries

PrimeEngineAI regularly identifies large prime numbers that extend beyond publicly known sets. These discoveries:
• Serve as reference points for primality validation benchmarking
• Contribute to the closing of prime gaps
• Populate private registries of verified primes for cryptographic or research use
Each confirmed prime is logged with its digit length, discovery method, verification steps, and symbolic/logical trace.
