# B. Validation Scripts & Pipeline Snapshots

PrimeEngineAI will provide downloadable scripts that replay and validate pipeline performance on public datasets. These scripts will output metrics such as candidate throughput, cache hit ratios, exclusion rule hits, and primality outcomes. Snapshot builds of each pipeline stage (symbolic filter, sieve, ML scoring, Miller-Rabin/ECPP) will be packaged via Docker containers for environment consistency.
