# 3. Modular Design & Extensibility

PrimeEngineAI has been designed from the ground up with modularity and extensibility in mind. This architectural approach ensures that each component within the system can evolve independently, be benchmarked in isolation, and be integrated flexibly across different deployment environments. The system is engineered to adapt to new techniques, algorithms, and performance requirements as research and needs evolve.
