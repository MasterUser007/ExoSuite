# C. Compounding Symbolic Intelligence

Symbolic filtering rules are versioned and refined using live activation logs:
• High-performing rules are retained and weighted more heavily
• Ineffective patterns are deprecated or refined
• Symbolic templates evolve through clustering and high-yield pattern extraction

This adaptive symbolic engine improves candidate rejection efficiency over time.
