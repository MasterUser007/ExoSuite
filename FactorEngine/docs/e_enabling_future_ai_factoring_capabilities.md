# E. Enabling Future AI Factoring Capabilities

The proprietary dataset is not only useful for prime detection—it lays the groundwork for next-generation factoring tools by offering:
• Statistical insight into composite structure distribution
• Residue and symbolic trace data for factoring complexity classification
• Input-output mappings for supervised training of predictive factoring models

As the dataset expands, PrimeEngineAI’s potential to move beyond prime discovery into intelligent composite analysis grows in parallel. The proprietary dataset produced by PrimeEngineAI is a living, compounding engine of insight. With every candidate tested and every symbolic rule executed, the system becomes more intelligent, more precise, and more valuable—technically, strategically, and commercially.
