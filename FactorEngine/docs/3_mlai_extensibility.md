# 3. ML/AI Extensibility

PrimeEngineAI is architected with native extensibility for modern machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) integrations. This design goes far beyond conventional number theory tools, which typically rely on static, rule-based filtering pipelines. PrimeEngineAIâ€™s modular, AI-ready infrastructure supports adaptive intelligence, symbolic rule evolution, real-time prioritization strategies, and future-state capabilities such as AI-driven factoring guidance.
