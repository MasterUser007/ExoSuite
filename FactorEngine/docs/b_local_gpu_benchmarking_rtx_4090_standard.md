# B. Local GPU Benchmarking (RTX 4090 Standard)

The NVIDIA RTX 4090 serves as the primary reference platform for local GPU benchmarking. It provides high core counts, fast memory bandwidth, and consistent CUDA performance. Tests on this platform help establish baseline efficiency metrics for GPU sieving, modular arithmetic, and parallel exclusion logic. This local benchmarking is critical for developers tuning kernel occupancy and symbolic caching algorithms.
