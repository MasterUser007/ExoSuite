# 3. Year 3 (2027–2028) – AI Factoring & Commercialization

The third year focuses on monetization of AI-powered factoring, platform licensing, and enterprise adoption:
• AI Factoring Prototype – Launch version 1 of the intelligent factoring engine based on symbolic trace features and ML-driven heuristics.
• Cryptanalysis Validation – Collaborate with academic partners to test AI-generated factoring predictions on encrypted sample datasets.
• Proprietary Knowledge Licensing – Package symbolic filters, gap closure records, and filtering trace logs for licensing to institutional clients.
• Enterprise Integration – Offer on-prem and API-based modules for blockchain, fintech, and cryptographic security vendors.
• Full SaaS Rollout – Release complete PrimeEngineAI SaaS platform with factoring-as-a-service tier and commercial symbolic exclusion SLAs.

This phased roadmap delivers progressive technology milestones, validated market fit, and defensible monetization pathways. PrimeEngineAI will evolve from a symbolic filtering engine into a fully integrated SaaS and AI-factoring platform—backed by proprietary data, trusted metrics, and scientific credibility.
