# C. Symbolic Filtering Data

Symbolic rule performance is tracked across digit classes, batch contexts, and candidate characteristics. PrimeEngineAI compiles an evolving symbolic dataset that includes:
• Rule activation frequencies and filter accuracy
• Composite classes best served by each symbolic family
• Success rates of tiered cache logic across prime-rich vs. sparse regions
This data informs rule evolution, tier pruning, and symbolic family augmentation.
