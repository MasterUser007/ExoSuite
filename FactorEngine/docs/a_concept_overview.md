# A. Concept Overview

Unlike supervised learning, which relies on labeled data, reinforcement learning focuses on making decisions that maximize cumulative reward over time. In the context of PrimeEngineAI, the RL agent observes outcomes of symbolic and ML-filtered candidate batches, then adjusts its prioritization policies based on which traits most often lead to successful early exclusion or downstream primality verification. This allows the model to develop efficient, adaptive strategies that outperform static ranking or heuristic ordering methods.
