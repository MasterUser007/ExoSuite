# C. Evolving Symbolic Exclusion Rules

Symbolic rule families are continuously tuned using real-world candidate traces. For each rule, the dataset tracks:
• Activation frequency and candidate characteristics
• Filtering precision across digit classes
• Conflict and redundancy indicators

This feedback enables adaptive pruning, rule generalization, and tier-specific optimization over time.
