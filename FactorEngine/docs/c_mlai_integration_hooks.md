# C. ML/AI Integration Hooks

PrimeEngineAI is future-ready with designated ML/AI hooks for reinforcement learning models and heuristic filtering. Candidate scoring engines can incorporate predictive models to guide the prioritization of prime-rich search zones. Symbolic patterns observed during execution can be logged and used to train new models for adaptive exclusion strategies. This integration ensures continual learning and optimization as data accumulates.
