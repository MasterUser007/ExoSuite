# E. Performance Metrics from Prior Pipeline Runs

Each pipeline run generates rich telemetry on candidate throughput, cache utilization, symbolic rule activations, and latency distributions. These metrics are compiled into a time-series ML-ready dataset that helps:
• Correlate performance with model accuracy
• Identify stages where symbolic filtering or ML predictions reduce or increase workload
• Inform model retraining intervals based on computational drift or throughput anomalies

By maintaining a highly structured and continuously updated proprietary dataset, PrimeEngineAI ensures its ML systems evolve in sync with pipeline behavior. This dataset supports supervised learning, rule optimization, and real-time decision guidance while preserving scientific traceability and reproducibility.
