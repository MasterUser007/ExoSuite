# F. AI Factoring Heuristics

Emerging research datasets are being created to support predictive models for factoring strategy development. These include:
• Composite candidate classification heuristics
• Symbolic complexity-to-factoring cost correlations
• Early probabilistic signals for ECM or sieving suitability
These knowledge artifacts will serve future modules focused on intelligent composite analysis and hybrid prime/factor prediction.

Each of these proprietary knowledge streams contributes to PrimeEngineAI’s unique value proposition, combining discovery, verification, and adaptive intelligence to form a scalable and defensible intellectual property framework.
