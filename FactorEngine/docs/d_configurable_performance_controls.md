To balance accuracy and speed, the system allows administrators or researchers to set confidence thresholds. This includes defining how many Millerâ€“Rabin rounds to apply per digit length or category of candidate. Auto-scaling heuristics can adjust the number of rounds dynamically based on CPU/GPU load or prior cache confidence.
