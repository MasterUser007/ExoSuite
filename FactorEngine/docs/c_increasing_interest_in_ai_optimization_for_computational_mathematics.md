# C. Increasing Interest in AI Optimization for Computational Mathematics

There is a surge in applying machine learning and reinforcement learning to classical mathematical problems. PrimeEngineAI:
• Uses ML to improve symbolic filtering heuristics
• Applies RL to reorder candidate testing for optimal yield
• Logs symbolic exclusion outcomes for retraining models and detecting anomalies

This makes it one of the first prime-discovery tools to merge classical logic with adaptive AI behavior.
