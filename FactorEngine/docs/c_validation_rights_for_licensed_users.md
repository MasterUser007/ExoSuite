# C. Validation Rights for Licensed Users

All licensing agreements include structured rights for internal audit and validation, including:
• Access to test benchmarks and symbolic exclusion traces
• Documentation of pipeline outcomes and symbolic filter efficacy
• Model inference logging with versioned change tracking

These audit provisions support commercial trust, scientific reproducibility, and legal enforceability. PrimeEngineAI’s legal validation and audit transparency frameworks provide a dual layer of credibility: Scientific and Contractual. These measures ensure that users, partners, and institutional stakeholders can trust in the integrity, reliability, and protection of the platform and its growing proprietary knowledge base.
