# International Patent Protection

Depending on commercialization progress, additional protections under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and direct international filings may be pursued. Target jurisdictions for international IP protection include:
• European Union (EPO)
• Canada (CIPO)
• United Kingdom (UKIPO)
• Australia (IP Australia)
• Japan (JPO)

These jurisdictions are prioritized based on cryptography market presence, academic interest, and commercial deployment targets. The patent pending status establishes clear legal precedence and offers immediate protection for PrimeEngineAI’s foundational innovations. Further enforcement and expansion of the IP portfolio are planned as the platform moves through commercialization and global deployment.
