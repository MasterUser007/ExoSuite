# B. Pipeline Architecture

The structural design of PrimeEngineAI’s modular discovery pipeline is proprietary, including:
• Stage-based filtering logic (truncation, symbolic, sieve, remainder, GMP)
• Tiered cache lookup structure and symbolic exclusion prioritization
• Isolated benchmarking and extensibility modules

This pipeline design enables component-level flexibility and deterministic reproducibility.
