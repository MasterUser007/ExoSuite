# C. Continuous Performance & Accuracy Monitoring

Real-time telemetry monitors performance metrics including candidate throughput, false positive/negative rates, pipeline latency (p50, p95, p99), and hardware utilization. Deviations from historical baselines—such as slower sieving or increased cache misses—trigger alerts. These metrics are logged, visualized via Prometheus/Grafana dashboards, and used to identify regressions early, support tuning, and inform rollback decisions.

Together, regular test suite maintenance, validation datasets, and performance monitoring form the core of PrimeEngineAI’s risk mitigation strategy. These ensure the pipeline remains stable, efficient, and scientifically trustworthy as it scales.
