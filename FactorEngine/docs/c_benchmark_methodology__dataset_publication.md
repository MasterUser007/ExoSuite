# C. Benchmark Methodology & Dataset Publication

To ensure repeatability and peer verification, PrimeEngineAI will:
• Publish the input candidate datasets (digit-class stratified, hash-validated)
• Release the benchmark methodology including pipeline parameters, exclusions, hardware profiles, and runtime constraints
• Provide execution logs and hashed output traces for each stage and test run

This transparency will allow third-party reviewers to validate both system behavior and performance outcomes.
