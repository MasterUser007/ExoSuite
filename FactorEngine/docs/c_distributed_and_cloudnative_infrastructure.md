# C. Distributed and Cloud-Native Infrastructure

PrimeEngineAI integrates seamlessly with distributed cloud infrastructure. Core components include:
• Docker containers for reproducible, portable deployments
• AWS Terraform modules for automated infrastructure provisioning
• Configuration profiles for p4d, g4dn, and c6i AWS instances
• Support for cloud-native metrics and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch)

This allows enterprises to scale across multiple nodes, achieve fault tolerance, and perform large-scale candidate testing efficiently.
