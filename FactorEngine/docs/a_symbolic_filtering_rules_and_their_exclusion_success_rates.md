# A. Symbolic Filtering Rules and Their Exclusion Success Rates

Each symbolic exclusion rule is tracked for its activation frequency, exclusion verdict, and long-term efficacy across digit classes. This information forms labeled input data for the ML models, allowing the system to:
• Learn which symbolic patterns are most predictive of compositeness
• Weight rules dynamically based on empirical performance
• Identify underperforming or redundant symbolic patterns
