# E. ML Training Datasets

Structured training sets are created from all symbolic filter, remainder analysis, and final validation results. These datasets:
• Enable supervised learning for next-generation ML classifiers
• Support retraining cycles for decision trees, neural forests, and hybrid scoring models
• Preserve audit-ready traceability between candidate input and training label
They are versioned, hash-validated, and monitored for class imbalance or drift.
