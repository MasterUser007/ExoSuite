# D. Anomaly Detection for Underperforming Symbolic Rules

Using historical performance data, ML-based anomaly detectors will monitor the long-term effectiveness of symbolic rules. Rules that begin producing poor hit rates, increased false positives, or redundant logic will be flagged for review. This helps maintain symbolic cache precision while reducing filter bloat and computational overhead. Flagged rules can either be disabled, retrained, or archived depending on their statistical impact.

These forward-looking applications of ML and RL ensure PrimeEngineAI continues to improve in intelligence, efficiency, and scalability without disrupting the mathematical foundations of its deterministic core. The hybrid architecture supports innovation in filtering, prioritization, and long-term learning for large-scale prime discovery.
