# Scope of Patent Coverage

The filed patent application includes claims addressing:
• Symbolic rule-based exclusion of prime candidates using multi-tier cache structures.
• Modular pipeline design enabling dynamic reconfiguration of candidate evaluation stages.
• CUDA-based sieving systems for high-throughput parallel exclusion of composite numbers.
• Infinitesimal remainder analysis heuristics used to pre-filter candidates prior to Miller–Rabin testing.
• ML and RL model hooks to automate exclusion ranking and symbolic rule evolution.
• Logging, metrics, and validation pipelines for reproducibility and audit support.
