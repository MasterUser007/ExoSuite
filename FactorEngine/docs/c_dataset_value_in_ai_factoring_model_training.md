# C. Dataset Value in AI Factoring Model Training

The dataset includes valuable structural traits of composite candidates, prime rejections, and rule failures—making it ideal for:
• Training supervised classifiers to predict factorability
• Evaluating structural complexity for ECM or sieve-based factor attempts
• Supporting symbolic-to-factoring trace models for future cryptanalysis

No public dataset currently offers this level of granularity tied to proven symbolic rule systems and ML model decisions.
