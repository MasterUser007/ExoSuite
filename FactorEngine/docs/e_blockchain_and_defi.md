# E. Blockchain and DeFi

Blockchain protocols require secure, unpredictable primes for consensus randomization, signature schemes, and validator key generation. PrimeEngineAI:
• Integrates into node pipelines for low-latency prime discovery
• Supports smart contract APIs for cryptographically secure randomness
• Provides externally verifiable filtering pipelines for decentralized audits
