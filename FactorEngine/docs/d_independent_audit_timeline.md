# D. Independent Audit Timeline

The benchmark report and dataset will be submitted for review to multiple academic institutions with expertise in computational number theory. Target institutions include:
• MIT (Applied Math & Cryptography Lab)
• Stanford (Symbolic Systems Program)
• University of Waterloo (Number Theory Group)

Validation will occur in Q3 2025, with findings expected to be published alongside the open benchmark documentation.

This benchmarking initiative positions PrimeEngineAI as a transparent, performance-driven platform that holds itself accountable to both industry and academic standards. The results will help differentiate the platform based on measurable, reproducible superiority.
