# C. Foundation for Future AI Factoring Engine

PrimeEngineAI’s ML/RL infrastructure is forward-compatible with factoring assistance features. Planned extensions include:
• Predictive models for factorability of composite candidates
• Structural complexity estimation based on symbolic and numerical traits
• Supervised models trained to identify efficient factoring techniques based on input patterns

These integrations will position PrimeEngineAI not just as a discovery engine but also as a strategic analytical platform for composite number evaluation.
