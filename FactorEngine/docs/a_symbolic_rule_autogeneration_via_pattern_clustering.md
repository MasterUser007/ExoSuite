# A. Symbolic Rule Auto-Generation via Pattern Clustering

Future versions of PrimeEngineAI will support automated discovery of symbolic filters using unsupervised clustering techniques. By analyzing large volumes of labeled composite data, ML models can identify repeating digit structures, residue patterns, or symbolic fail cases that are not covered by existing hand-crafted rules. These emergent patterns can then be translated into symbolic templates for batch exclusion, thereby reducing the human effort required to engineer rules manually.
