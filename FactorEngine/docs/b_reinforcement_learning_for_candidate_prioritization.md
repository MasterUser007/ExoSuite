# B. Reinforcement Learning for Candidate Prioritization

A core extensibility feature is the RL policy layer designed to:
• Learn optimal candidate routing through symbolic and probabilistic stages
• Reward early exclusion success and low-compute high-confidence verdicts
• Adapt search behavior to optimize for composite rejection, false positive reduction, and throughput

This capability creates a long-term adaptive engine that evolves with system use and improves discovery yield over time.
