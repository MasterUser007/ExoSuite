# 5. External Validation Toolkit

To support independent verification of PrimeEngineAIâ€™s performance and scientific claims, a benchmark validation toolkit will be publicly released in conjunction with the Q3 2025 benchmark dataset launch. This toolkit enables third-party validators to test filtering accuracy, latency, and reproducibility across multiple runtime environments, while protecting proprietary symbolic assets.
