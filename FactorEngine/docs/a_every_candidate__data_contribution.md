# A. Every Candidate = Data Contribution

Each numeric candidate processed by PrimeEngineAI generates structured metadata including:
• Symbolic rule activations and verdicts
• Cache tier lookup outcomes
• Remainder analysis results
• Primality testing verdict (composite/prime)
• ML scoring output and decision confidence

These logs contribute directly to symbolic tuning, rule pruning, and ML retraining workflows.
