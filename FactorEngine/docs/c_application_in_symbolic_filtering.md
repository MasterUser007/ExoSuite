# C. Application in Symbolic Filtering

The planned NDF integration will operate on expanded symbolic metadata, including multi-tier cache outcomes, digit symmetry traits, and remainder histogram profiles. These features are expected to benefit from the non-linear classification capability of NDFs, which will allow the model to identify subtle but statistically significant structural indicators of compositeness.
