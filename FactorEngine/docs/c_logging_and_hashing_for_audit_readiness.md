# C. Logging and Hashing for Audit Readiness

To support third-party validation, all ML inference outcomes are:
• Time-stamped and tagged with candidate feature metadata
• Logged alongside symbolic verdicts and exclusion decisions
• Cryptographically hashed using SHA-256 or similar secure digest methods

These hashes are published in public benchmarking reports, allowing external auditors to confirm that ML outputs match what was originally evaluated without requiring access to proprietary ML models or symbolic datasets. This approach balances transparency with IP protection.

Through layered validation, controlled human oversight, and cryptographic audit preparation, PrimeEngineAI maintains confidence in its ML-powered filtering while upholding scientific integrity. This framework ensures that machine learning complements deterministic logic rather than bypassing it, preserving both performance and reproducibility.
