# E. Modular Architecture – Benchmarking, Extension, and Efficiency

Each stage of the pipeline is fully modular. This architecture supports:
• Isolated testing and benchmarking of symbolic filters, GPU sieves, or ML classifiers
• Rule plugin injection for rapid experimentation and tuning
• Minimal overhead for deterministic stages through early rejection and rule-driven flow control

This design enables rapid iteration, extensibility, and operational resilience. By combining adaptive symbolic logic, massively parallel GPU operations, smart probabilistic heuristics, and proven deterministic tests, PrimeEngineAI achieves a level of technical superiority that far exceeds conventional prime analysis tools. Its hybrid architecture is built not only for speed and scale but also for precision, auditability, and future extensibility.
