# D. Stage Latency Benchmarking on Standardized Hardware

The validation toolkit includes utilities to benchmark latency (p50, p95, p99) for symbolic filtering, GPU sieving, and GMP/ECPP validation on standard hardware environments. Test harnesses support CPU-only and GPU-accelerated configurations, with reference benchmarks available for comparison against RTX 4090 and AWS p4d-class hardware baselines.
