# C. Hardware-Aware and Cloud-Scalable by Design

As GPU infrastructure, cloud orchestration, and serverless computing mature, PrimeEngineAI is built to:
• Scale horizontally across multi-GPU cloud environments
• Optimize GPU batch distribution and CUDA occupancy with hardware introspection
• Deploy easily via Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform

This ensures that the platform is ready to take advantage of future hardware breakthroughs without architectural overhaul.
