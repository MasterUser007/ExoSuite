# B. Closed Prime Gaps – Systematic Documentation and Cataloging

Gap closure—identifying previously unresolved intervals between consecutive primes—is a key measure of PrimeEngineAI’s reach. Each closed gap includes:
• Start and end bounds, and gap length
• Symbolic exclusion pattern trace
• Residue class behaviors and cache tier logs

Gap closure records are stored in an indexed, queryable format for downstream ML model training, citation in academic papers, and algorithm benchmarking.
