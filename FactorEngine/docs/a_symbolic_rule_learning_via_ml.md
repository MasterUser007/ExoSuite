# A. Symbolic Rule Learning via ML

PrimeEngineAI includes support for supervised learning modules that:
• Ingest labeled candidate outcomes (prime/composite)
• Analyze symbolic rule activation and filter precision
• Propose generalized symbolic templates based on pattern clustering

These features enable the system to refine, rank, or replace symbolic rules based on performance, reducing manual curation and supporting dynamic exclusion intelligence.
