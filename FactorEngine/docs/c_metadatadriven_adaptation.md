# C. Metadata-Driven Adaptation

Both ML and RL components operate on rich, pre-processed metadata extracted from each candidate. This includes:
• Digit-level patterning (terminal digits, repeat counts, symmetry).
• Cache tier performance outcomes.
• Symbolic rule activation frequency.
• Remainder and modulus traits (n mod p results).
• Time-to-classify statistics across stages.

This metadata structure allows for compact training data, quick model inference, and detailed audit trails for performance tuning. By incorporating ML for statistical pattern detection and RL for dynamic search optimization, PrimeEngineAI maintains a high-throughput pipeline that continuously improves over time while preserving deterministic core logic and mathematical auditability.
