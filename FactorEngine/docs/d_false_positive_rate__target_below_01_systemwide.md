# D. False Positive Rate – Target: Below 0.1% System-Wide

Maintaining a false positive rate below 0.1% is essential for operational efficiency, ML retraining reliability, and end-user trust. Tracking efforts include:
• Logging of all symbolic, probabilistic, and deterministic verdict discrepancies
• Tuning of rule ranking weights based on symbolic misclassification logs
• Quarterly internal validation cycles with independently seeded test sets

Sustained false positive suppression is essential to ensure filtering credibility and prevent downstream computational waste.

Together, these proprietary knowledge milestones form a live, evolving index of PrimeEngineAI’s accuracy, effectiveness, and long-term value. They support scientific validation, commercial licensing, ML retraining cycles, and the platform’s reputation as a credible and powerful tool for scalable prime discovery.
