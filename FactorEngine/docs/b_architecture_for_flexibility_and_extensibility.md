# B. Architecture for Flexibility and Extensibility

PrimeEngineAI’s modular design enables:
• Plug-and-play replacement of symbolic rules, GPU kernels, and probabilistic filters
• Targeted benchmarking of algorithm modules in isolation
• Integration with ML and RL modules through defined hooks
• Tiered caching systems that support rule versioning and real-time adjustment

This allows continuous upgrades and testing without destabilizing the full pipeline—supporting innovation and rapid iteration.
