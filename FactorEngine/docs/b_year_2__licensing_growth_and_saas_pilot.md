# B. Year 2 – Licensing Growth and SaaS Pilot

In the second year, PrimeEngineAI begins to scale recurring revenue via:
• Growth of annual professional and enterprise licensing
• Early SaaS pilot for on-demand cloud access
• Symbolic filter and benchmark data licensing for academic research and protocol simulations

This phase transitions the platform toward cloud-native models and begins building a subscription base.
