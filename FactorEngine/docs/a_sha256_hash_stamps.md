# A. SHA-256 Hash Stamps

Each validated prime discovery and closed prime gap entry is hashed using SHA-256 and stored alongside a trusted timestamp. This ensures:
• Immutable record of discovery
• Cryptographically verifiable proof of chronological order
• Compliance with future third-party audit standards

These hashes are embedded into public validation reports and optionally broadcast via decentralized hash registries (e.g., IPFS or blockchain) for future proof.
