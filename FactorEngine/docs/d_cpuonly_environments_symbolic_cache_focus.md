# D. CPU-Only Environments (Symbolic Cache Focus)

CPU-only environments are benchmarked specifically to test symbolic filtering speed, cache pruning performance, and ML-free pipeline operation. These tests isolate symbolic pattern evaluation, rule matching speed, and cache hit ratios across various digit ranges. This mode ensures PrimeEngineAIâ€™s core filtering logic remains performant even without GPU acceleration, useful for lower-resource academic or embedded deployments.
