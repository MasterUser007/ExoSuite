# C. False Positive and False Negative Rate Validation

The toolkit computes and verifies the rates of:
• False Positives – Composites incorrectly labeled as probable primes.
• False Negatives – Primes incorrectly filtered as composites.

These statistics are validated against public datasets using ground-truth metadata, allowing third parties to confirm the claimed error boundaries.
