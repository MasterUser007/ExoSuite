# A. Symbolic Filtering â€“ Adaptive Exclusion Engine

PrimeEngineAI uses dynamic symbolic rule templates and exclusion families to identify composite patterns early in the pipeline. These rules include digit-ending templates, repetition structures, modulo residue exclusions, and mirrored sequence filters. Symbolic rules are ranked, pruned, and retrained over time to reflect real-world candidate performance and evolving discovery targets.
