# D. Peer Tool Comparisons (GIMPS, msieve, etc.)

To position PrimeEngineAI within the current landscape, benchmark comparisons will be made with widely respected tools: GIMPS (focused on Mersenne primes), msieve (factorization suite), and GMP-ECM (elliptic curve method). Metrics for comparison include execution time, false discovery rate, prime density yield, and hardware efficiency (throughput per watt).
