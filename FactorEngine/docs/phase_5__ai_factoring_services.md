# Phase 5 – AI Factoring Services

As PrimeEngineAI evolves into intelligent composite analysis, its factoring module will support:
• Transaction-based pricing for real-time factoring attempts (e.g., composite key submission and breakdown)
• API-based subscription for algorithmic clients in cybersecurity, academic testing, or key validation
• Volume-based or licensing access for enterprise decryption or cryptanalysis workflows

These services will address a growing market for factoring-as-a-service, especially in post-quantum cryptography and digital forensics.

PrimeEngineAI’s phased monetization model provides a scalable and defensible path from expert consulting to recurring SaaS and transactional data services. Each phase builds on the last—strengthening IP value, capturing revenue, and expanding market presence.
