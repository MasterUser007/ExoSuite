# C. Comparative Benchmarking Study

To contextualize PrimeEngineAI’s performance, a comparative benchmarking study will be conducted using established tools:
• GIMPS – For extremely large Mersenne prime discovery via distributed computing.
• OpenPFGW – For general-purpose probable prime testing.
• msieve – For integer factorization and root-based polynomial analysis.

Metrics will include:
• Candidate throughput per second.
• Latency per stage (symbolic, sieving, probabilistic testing).
• False discovery rates.
• Resource efficiency (throughput per watt or per core-hour).

All results will be shared in a standardized tabular format for academic reference and industry comparison.
