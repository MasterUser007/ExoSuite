# D. CPU & GPU Utilization

Real-time monitoring of CPU and GPU utilization allows administrators to validate system efficiency. GPU occupancy levels, memory bandwidth, thread concurrency, and I/O wait times are all captured. This enables PrimeEngineAI to tune batch sizes, offload stages between CPU/GPU, and auto-adjust based on deployment constraints.
