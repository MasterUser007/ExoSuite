# D. Methodology & Transparency

Benchmarking methodology will be published alongside the datasets, including:
• Environment specs (CPU/GPU model, memory, OS).
• Batch size and candidate set generation logic.
• Symbolic rule configuration and cache layer versions.
• Number of Miller–Rabin rounds and confidence thresholds.

This documentation ensures full reproducibility of all experimental conditions and encourages external review.
