# A. Targeted Pilot Partner Segments

PrimeEngineAI will engage early licensing pilots with three key communities:
• Blockchain Security Firms – To secure validator key pipelines, verifiable randomness, and zk-SNARK efficiency.
• Cryptography Research Groups – To accelerate large-prime validation, hybrid cryptographic protocol R&D, and key structure testing.
• Academic Number Theory Labs – To support high-throughput exploration of prime gaps, symbolic rule testing, and heuristic validation.

These partners will use PrimeEngineAI to validate production pipelines and extend the scientific frontier in prime discovery applications.
