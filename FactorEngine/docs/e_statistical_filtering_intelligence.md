# E. Statistical Filtering Intelligence

Patterns in remainder behavior are often non-obvious but statistically significant. PrimeEngineAI tracks which symbolic patterns, digit classes, and modulo outcomes correlate with later Miller-Rabin failures. Over time, this informs reinforcement learning modules or rule tuning. Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis acts as a feedback-enabling, low-cost statistical checkpoint that complements the symbolic and GPU layers.
