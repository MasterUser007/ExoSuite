# B. Modular Algorithm Architecture and Isolation Layers

The system’s modular design allows for:
• Independent benchmarking and upgrade of symbolic, probabilistic, and deterministic stages
• Rapid plug-in and evaluation of new filtering rules and ML classifiers
• Controlled experimentation without affecting production validation accuracy

This flexible yet secure architecture supports accelerated R&D while preserving long-term stability and auditability.
