# C. Symbolic Rule Evolution – Annual Filtering Model Updates

PrimeEngineAI updates its symbolic filtering model annually through empirical evaluation and machine learning feedback. Milestone deliverables include:
• Deprecated symbolic rules (low-yield or redundant)
• New symbolic families (generated by symbolic clustering or ML inference)
• Versioned symbolic filter trees and ranking matrices

These updates ensure continued improvement in early-stage filtering efficiency and support modular benchmarking by partner institutions.
