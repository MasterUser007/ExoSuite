# D. Closed Prime Gaps

As PrimeEngineAI contributes to closing known prime gaps, each resolution event is logged with the gap’s boundaries, digit class, and time-to-close. These closure logs are used to:
• Train RL systems on region prioritization
• Refine symbolic heuristics for gap-border candidates
• Improve understanding of prime density irregularities over large numerical ranges
