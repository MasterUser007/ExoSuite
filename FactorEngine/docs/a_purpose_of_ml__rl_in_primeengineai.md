# A. Purpose of ML & RL in PrimeEngineAI

Machine Learning (ML) is used to improve symbolic filtering precision by learning traits common to composite or marginal candidates. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is intended to optimize scoring functions, symbolic rule weights, and candidate prioritization over time. These systems operate in a complementary manner, enabling the pipeline to evolve intelligently in response to changing input characteristics.
