# Proprietary Knowledge Asset Categories

The proprietary dataset includes, but is not limited to:

• New Prime Discoveries:

Timestamped, hash-verified primes discovered and validated by the PrimeEngineAI pipeline, with complete symbolic and testing metadata.

Prime Gaps Closed:

Systematic documentation of numeric ranges resolved to contain consecutive prime intervals previously unverified.

• Symbolic Filtering Rules:

Original exclusion templates, ML-generated symbolic logic, rule generalizations, and ranked filter structures.

• False Positive Rejection Logs:

Logs detailing candidate misclassification, rule activation paths, and metadata from symbolic cache evaluations.

• ML Training Data:

Structured input/output datasets including digit features, symbolic activation profiles, and filtering verdicts.

• AI Factoring Heuristics:

Symbolic-to-factor prediction models, classification layers, and associated training results.

•Performance Benchmark Data:

Runtime, latency, and candidate throughput results across diverse hardware environments and candidate pools.

• Deployment & Usage Logs:

Internal activity metadata tied to runtime parameters, symbolic rule application rates, and compute resource utilization.
