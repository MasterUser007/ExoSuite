# 6. Model Validation & External Audit Readiness

To ensure the reliability, fairness, and scientific auditability of all machine learning (ML)-driven exclusion decisions, PrimeEngineAI enforces strict validation and logging protocols. These protocols are designed to prevent model drift, safeguard against bias, and prepare the system for independent third-party evaluation. The combination of deterministic rule comparison, human review, and cryptographic logging forms the foundation of trust in the ML components of the pipeline.
