# A. Training Data for Symbolic Rule Evolution

Symbolic exclusion rules that effectively identify prime-averse patterns are also key to identifying composite structure markers. The same metadata used to block false positives in primality testing—such as digit repetition, residue class failures, and cache-tier mismatches—can be repurposed to train classifiers and symbolic heuristics that suggest potential factorization approaches or complexity estimates.
