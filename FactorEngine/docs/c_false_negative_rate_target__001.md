# C. False Negative Rate (Target: < 0.01%)

This tracks the proportion of actual primes that are mistakenly excluded early in the pipeline. PrimeEngineAI targets a false negative rate under 0.01% by using layered filtering and adaptive ML scoring strategies. This ensures that real primes are not overlooked even in high-throughput filtering modes.
