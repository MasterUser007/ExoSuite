# B. Exclusion Patterns Reducing Search Space Complexity

The dataset includes detailed information on symbolic and ML-based exclusion logic for composite-rich regions. These records help:
• Eliminate candidates unlikely to yield tractable factors
• Focus computational resources on high-potential structural traits
• Minimize redundancy in search spaces by tracking historically poor-yield numeric zones

This leads to faster, more targeted factoring passes when integrated with known techniques like Pollard’s Rho, ECM, or lattice sieves.
