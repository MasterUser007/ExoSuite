# B. Human Review of Symbolic Rule Refinements

Symbolic rules proposed, weighted, or deprioritized by ML models undergo formal human review before integration into the active cache. Review criteria include:
• Historical precision/recall performance across multiple digit classes
• Explainability of the exclusion pattern in mathematical terms
• Consistency with known composite structures

This ensures symbolic integrity and prevents degradation of rule trustworthiness due to automated adjustments.
