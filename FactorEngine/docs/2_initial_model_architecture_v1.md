# 2. Initial Model Architecture (v1)

The initial implementation of PrimeEngineAIâ€™s symbolic filtering ML model (version 1) introduces a lightweight supervised classifier to augment static symbolic rule sets. Its purpose is to catch structurally ambiguous candidates that may bypass rule-based filters, thereby improving exclusion precision while maintaining high throughput. The architecture emphasizes interpretability, speed, and ease of retraining.
