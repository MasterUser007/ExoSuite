# 5. Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis

Infinitesimal Remainder Analysis is a lightweight probabilistic filtering layer in the PrimeEngineAI pipeline. It serves as a final check before invoking resource-heavy primality tests. This stage helps reduce the number of false positives, ensuring only high-confidence candidates progress further. While not mathematically deterministic, its speed and filtering power make it a critical component in large-scale prime discovery.
