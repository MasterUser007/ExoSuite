# B. Confirmation of Hash Chains and Timestamps

PrimeEngineAI uses cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) and trusted timestamps to record the time and content of discoveries. Auditors can:
• Validate hashes against published benchmark datasets.
• Confirm the sequential integrity of the discovery timeline.
• Optionally use decentralized registries (e.g., blockchain logs or IPFS snapshots) to confirm non-repudiation.

These timestamped hashes serve as tamper-proof evidence of work performed and results obtained.
