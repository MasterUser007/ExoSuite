# A. Proprietary Dataset as a Compounding Knowledge Moat

PrimeEngineAI continuously generates a growing proprietary dataset through symbolic filter performance logs, validated prime discoveries, closed gap records, and ML-enhanced exclusion traces. This data:
• Enables predictive filtering models and adaptive scoring logic
• Cannot be reconstructed from public benchmarks or static rule sets
• Serves as training ground for future AI-driven factoring algorithms

The result is a dataset that becomes more valuable and irreplicable with each execution cycle.
