# F. Enterprise Cloud and Research SaaS

Enterprises, national labs, and research institutions require scalable, modular tools that can:
• Deploy across hybrid or multi-cloud architectures
• Offer isolated symbolic rule testing and benchmarking
• Integrate into ML/AI-driven research environments

PrimeEngineAI’s containerized infrastructure (Docker, Terraform, Prometheus) supports full deployment in cloud-native platforms and scales horizontally for large-scale prime computation needs.

By serving these high-value market segments—each with distinct technical and regulatory demands—PrimeEngineAI is positioned to become the foundational platform for next-generation prime-based applications in cryptography, finance, research, and decentralized computing.
