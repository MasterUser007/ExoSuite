# B. Immutable Logging to Encrypted Storage

All symbolic filtering, ML inference, remainder analysis, and primality validation results are logged to encrypted storage volumes. These logs are version-controlled and locked post-ingestion, ensuring:
• No retroactive edits to discovery logs
• Full audit trails of test decisions
• High-trust environments for ML retraining or symbolic rule validation

Immutable logs serve as the foundation for knowledge reproducibility, rollback safety, and forensic traceability.
