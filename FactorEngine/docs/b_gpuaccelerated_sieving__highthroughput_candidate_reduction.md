# B. GPU-Accelerated Sieving – High-Throughput Candidate Reduction

GPU-enabled sieving accelerates the elimination of multiple candidates in parallel by leveraging CUDA-optimized kernels. Batch scaling algorithms adapt dynamically to GPU core availability and candidate density, enabling:
• Real-time prime space scanning
• Composite exclusion across wide ranges
• Symbolic score-driven GPU resource allocation
