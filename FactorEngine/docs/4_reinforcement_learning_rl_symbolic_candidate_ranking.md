# 4. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Symbolic Candidate Ranking

To further optimize symbolic candidate filtering and throughput efficiency, PrimeEngineAI is developing a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based ranking system. This system is designed to prioritize the sequence in which numeric candidates are processed by learning which filtering patterns lead to the most successful early rejections of composite numbers. The RL agent learns to allocate computational focus and ordering decisions based on long-term feedback, resulting in a smarter and more adaptive pipeline.
