# B. Accuracy Metrics: False Positives & Negatives

To evaluate effectiveness, the system logs false positive rates (composites incorrectly passed) and false negatives (primes incorrectly filtered). Symbolic filtering and probabilistic layers emit precision and recall scores over time. These metrics are critical for tuning symbolic rules, optimizing threshold configurations, and informing ML scoring layers.
