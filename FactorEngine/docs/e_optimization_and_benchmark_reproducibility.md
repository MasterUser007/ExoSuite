# E. Optimization and Benchmark Reproducibility

All metrics are logged and time-stamped for reproducibility. Developers and researchers can compare runs, retest configurations, and benchmark upgrades using consistent baselines. The performance data also enables predictive capacity planning, energy efficiency modeling, and rapid feedback loops during symbolic or ML rule training.
