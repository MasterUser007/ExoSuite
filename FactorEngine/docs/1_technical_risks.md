# 1. Technical Risks

Risk: ML symbolic filtering and RL candidate ranking may underperform initial expectations.

Likelihood: Medium

Impact: High

Mitigation: Incremental rollout with fallback to validated symbolic rules. Benchmark continuously and refine models.

Risk: Data integrity risk from symbolic cache corruption or inconsistency in multi-node deployments.

Likelihood: Medium

Impact: High

Mitigation: Implement rigorous cache validation checks, backup mechanisms, and failover cache layers.
