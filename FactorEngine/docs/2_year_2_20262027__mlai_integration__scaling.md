# 2. Year 2 (2026–2027) – ML/AI Integration & Scaling

The second year expands machine learning integration and SaaS delivery capability:
• RL Symbolic Filtering – Implement reinforcement learning model to optimize candidate prioritization and symbolic rule sequencing.
• Factoring Heuristics – Deploy prototype symbolic+numeric models to classify candidates by likely factoring complexity.
• Dataset Expansion – Ingest annotated performance traces and partner-sourced numeric regions into symbolic rule refinement engine.
• SaaS Platform Beta – Launch beta version of the PrimeEngineAI cloud service with pay-as-you-go symbolic testing and benchmark pipelines.
• Distributed Testing – Expand benchmark execution and load testing across cloud-based, multi-node environments (e.g., AWS P4d).
