# C. Academic Audit and Third-Party Review

An independent academic review is scheduled to begin following the dataset release. The audit will assess the accuracy of filtering layers, efficiency of symbolic exclusions, probabilistic false positive rates, and determinism in ECPP validation. Comparative benchmarks will be conducted against known tools including GIMPS, msieve, and open-source primality libraries. All audit results will be published, with reproducibility as a core requirement.
